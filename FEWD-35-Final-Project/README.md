FEWD 35 Final Project Overview:

As a final project for the Front-End Web Development course at General Assembly, I built a prototype blog site with basic functionalities and responsive features. My goal with this project was to create a website using my growing knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, and how to use and incorporate plugins. As I continue to learn new programming languages and JavaScript libraries I hope to build this website out into a fully functioning repository for my writing projects, using a content management system (CMS), SQL, or React. 

This project was a great learning experience in terms of effectively applying these web development skills in concert with one another, and serves as a great starting point for me to continue to build on. Through developing this project, I gained a better understanding of the value of clearly structured code, the importance of refactoring, and the effectiveness of a user-centric design.

Functionalities

-Responsive breakpoints: I created a breakpoint for the sidebar at 768px so that the sidebar will collapse under the main-feature article, with both sidebar items then sitting in a row next to each other as opposed to in a column.

-Hovertext: I applied hovertext on the Nav tabs and the article headlines to mimic the look of a news or blog site with active links to articles. 

-Plugins: By incorporating the ScrollTo and Slick Carousel plugins, I learned some of the benefits and challenges involved in using plugins. Using a plugin avoids reinventing the wheel when it comes to introducing a certain functionality, but particularly in the case of the Slick Carousel, I had to do a lot in my stylesheet to make sure it looked and worked how I wanted it.

Next Steps

-Exploring options for either a CMS like WordPress or learning SQL to store and pull content from a SQL database.
